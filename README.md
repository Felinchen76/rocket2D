# ImageROCKET

This repository provides a simple implementation of the ROCKET (RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform) method adapted for image classification. The approach converts images into 1D sequences to allow ROCKET, originally designed for time series, to process image data.

The repository includes examples using standard datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10, along with basic evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

The goal is to illustrate how ROCKET can be applied to images in a straightforward, reproducible way.
